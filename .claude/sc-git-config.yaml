# SC:Git Configuration
# Project: codename-agent-smith (Agent Advisor)

sc_git:
  # Base branch for PR creation
  base_branch: main

  # Commit message settings
  commit:
    conventional_commits: true  # Use feat/fix/docs format
    auto_stage: true  # Auto-stage changes before commit
    scope_detection: true  # Auto-detect scope from changed files

  # PR settings
  pr:
    auto_validation: true  # Always run pre-PR validation (RECOMMENDED)
    draft: false  # Create normal PRs (not draft)
    auto_assign: true  # Auto-assign to PR creator
    include_validation_results: true  # Add validation summary to PR description

  # Push settings
  push:
    set_upstream: true  # Auto-set upstream on first push
    push_before_pr: true  # Auto-push when creating PR

# Integration with pre-pr-validation
# (These settings are inherited from .claude/pre-pr-config.yaml)
# To customize validation behavior, edit that file instead

# Notes:
# - auto_validation is ENABLED by default (safe, catches issues early)
# - Disable only if you have external CI that duplicates these checks
# - conventional_commits helps maintain clean git history
# - Validation results are included in PR description for reviewer context
